                <p>About project</p>
                <span>It's a game which is traditionally played on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally and that player wins who is able to make one of the mentioned pattern.</span>

                <span>
                <span>The development of the following screens of game:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>a welcome screen where the play button is available, user can click on it & move further in the game.</li>
                    <li>a screen for saving the sessions for every game played and displaying the results of previously played games, so that user can later check, resume the game or can play a new one.</li>
                    <li>the actual tic-tac-toe game screen which appears when user clicks button to play a new one or previously played. </li>
