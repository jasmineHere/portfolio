                <span>SalonStyle will be an appointment booking application. Nowadays, it has become difficult for everyone to take out time from busy work life schedule and visit salons to pamper themselves. This application will make this process easier for customers as they can choose services they want and book appointment in advance on their choice of date and time for that respective service without walking in to the salon first and asking for details. For now the development of this project is being done for a speicific salon.  </span>

                <p>My role in this project</p>
                <span>
                    We are implementing this idea for iOS as well as android platform. I am working on this project with my classmate, Dharshini Selvaraj, we both are managing equal development tasks be it front-end or back-end development. We have started with the wireframes, technical and functional specification, so the development of this project is still in progress. Stay tuned! it is expected to be complete by August, 2022.
