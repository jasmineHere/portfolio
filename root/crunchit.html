            <p>About project</p>
            <span>Our project idea is CrunchIt-an online food product delivering e-commerce application which will aim to provide (Indian) food items to people, especially of their own choice and the liberty of receiving ordered food items at their doorstep according to the time slot they choose. It will be different from other existing services because it will majorly benefit International students, new immigrants or anyone who is always looking to buy variety of Indian packaged food items or snacks anytime and anywhere, so this application will help by listing out all these specific items on a single platform from where anyone can add items to the virtual cart and do the online payment and then receive it as and when required. Whereas other services for e.g., Instacart, Walmart provide every kind of items but not specific like our app idea.</span>

            <p>My role in this project</p>
            <span>
                We are implementing this idea on a android appication using java. This project is being done collaboratively by a group of 5 people and we usually divide the roles according to the individual's interest. I mostly take part in the front-end development part. The development of this project is still in progress, it is expected to be complete by August, 2022.

                <span >
                    Gray and lite Blue have been the cold color for food or fresh things so we've used the same approach
                    for this too.
